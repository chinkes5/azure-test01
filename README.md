# azure-test01
initial testing to use Terraform with Azure. This is a copy, sort of, of what I made in the AWS terraform test repo. 

## Structure and Use
There are several terraform files to describe each kind of resource with a variable file to hold all the specific values used.

## Source Material
* [Starting with the Terraform example] (https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/azure-build?in=terraform/azure-get-started)
* [Adding Terragrunt into the mix] (https://gaunacode.com/using-terragrunt-to-deploy-to-azure)
* [2hr YouTube video on making Azure stuff with Terraform] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V53AHWun17s)

## Step 0
Things I had to do to get this so it would work-
1. Get Azure account
2. install Azure CLI (the command is in terraform guide)
